### Objective

This is the final excercise for computer architecture & organization lab. The reason I chosed this topic is that the simpler you begin the firmer you improve. It seem like a poor but it make sense that I tried combing all knowledge I have about the mcu into that, tried using all function blocks such as UART, timers, PWM, interrupts, ... From now, I could easily move on to the more difficult topic.

### Components

* LCD module for 16x2 LCD, could be used to alert or display something ( currently used for debug 🎃)
* Temperature module for 1-wire communication with Ds18b20 sensor. 📗
